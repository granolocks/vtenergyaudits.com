        <h2>About Mark Snyder and VT Energy Audits</h2>

<p><a href="/img/blower.jpg"><img class="round right" src="/img/blower_thumb.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>VT Energy Audits is a division of <strong>M.A. SNYDER CONSTRUCTION.</strong>
Mark A. Snyder lives in a historic building in Greensboro Bend, Vermont. He
knows COLD. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let my experience work for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mark has over 30 yrs experience as a builder and master carpenter and is a
published author constantly striving for excellence. On time...on budget...and
with great attention to detail. </p>

<p>Going  back to school to learn building science as a builder was a game
changer.  Mark now knows the answers to the questions and most importantly how
to test and verify scientifically.</p>

<h2>Building Science?</h2>

<p>As a Building Performance Institute certified energy auditor with a blower door
and infrared thermography technology we can measure air flow in pascels and
look deep into framing assemblies and show you where your house is deficient or
not.</p>

<p>Residential construction has changed very little since my great grand father
was a builder in the 1800s.  We viewed and built houses as a pile of lumber and
a series of steps in the correct order.  They were not designed for any kind of
energy efficiency.</p>

<p>Slowly that philosophy is changing. Now we view houses as a &quot;whole system&quot;.
Based on building science , they need to be efficient,healthy and durable-don&#39;t
you think your house should outlast your mortgage?</p>

<p>Building science is leading the way.  Understanding home building as a science
we can now test, scan, and quantify your home like never before.</p>
