<h2>What is &quot;Building Science&quot;?</h2>

<p>Residential construction has changed very little since Marks great grand father
was a builder in the 1800s.  In those days, builders viewed and built houses as
a pile of lumber and a series of steps in the correct order.  They were not
designed for any kind of energy efficiency.</p>

<p>Slowly that philosophy is changing. Now we view houses as a &quot;whole system&quot;.
Based on building science, they need to be efficient, healthy and durable
&mdash; don&#39;t you think your house should outlast your mortgage?</p>

<p>A BPI certified energy auditor with a blower door and infrared thermo graphs
technology can measure air flow in a building and look deep into framing
assemblies to show you where your house is deficient or confirm that it is not.</p>

<p>Building science is leading the way.  Understanding home building as a science
we can now test, scan, and quantify your home like never before.</p>
