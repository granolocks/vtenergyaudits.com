## What is an Energy Audit?

<a href="/img/airleakage.png"><img src="/img/airleakage_thumb.png" class="right"/></a>

It is an inspection , survey and analysis of energy use for energy conservation
in a building.  We test for air leakage and make cost effective suggestions for
lowering your energy use.  On average 10-35% savings are realistic.

> Build it tight-ventilate it right!


An energy auditor Looks for any health and safety issues. Safety is top
priority. First we test for carbon monoxide leakages. We test appliances for
safety and eficiency. We do a blower door test to check for air sealing. Next
we evaluate insulation performance and determine building air flow standard.
Taking the results of our testing and analysis we then make effective
recommendations for low cost/long term air quality and home efficiency
improvements.

We'll treat you and your home with respect and leave a happy customer.
