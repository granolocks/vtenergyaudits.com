Mark has over 30 yrs experience as a builder and master carpenter and is a

Going  back to school to learn building science as a builder was a game
changer.  Mark now knows the answers to the questions and most importantly how
to test and verify scientifically.

## Building Science?


As a Building Performance Institute certified energy auditor with a blower door
and infrared thermography technology we can measure air flow in pascels and
look deep into framing assemblies and show you where your house is deficient or
not.

Residential construction has changed very little since my great grand father
was a builder in the 1800s.  We viewed and built houses as a pile of lumber and
a series of steps in the correct order.  They were not designed for any kind of
energy efficiency.

Slowly that philosophy is changing. Now we view houses as a "whole system".
Based on building science , they need to be efficient,healthy and durable-don't
you think your house should outlast your mortgage?

Building science is leading the way.  Understanding home building as a science
we can now test, scan, and quantify your home like never before.
