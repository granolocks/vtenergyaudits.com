## What is "Building Science"?

Residential construction has changed very little since Marks great grand father
was a builder in the 1800s.  In those days, builders viewed and built houses as
a pile of lumber and a series of steps in the correct order.  They were not
designed for any kind of energy efficiency.

Slowly that philosophy is changing. Now we view houses as a "whole system".
Based on building science, they need to be efficient, healthy and durable
&mdash; don't you think your house should outlast your mortgage?

A BPI certified energy auditor with a blower door and infrared thermo graphs
technology can measure air flow in a building and look deep into framing
assemblies to show you where your house is deficient or confirm that it is not.

Building science is leading the way.  Understanding home building as a science
we can now test, scan, and quantify your home like never before.
